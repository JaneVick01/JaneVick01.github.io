  <li>
    It has always been my ambition to become a
successful IT specialist. It is a step towards my future career.
Thanks to my swift progress of my studies at Business Academy, it is glaring that studying is what I
would like to engage in even more. While studying at Business Academy, I developed a keen interest
in products, technology and their design. I consider it a vibrant experience to get the opportunity to meet
students from all over the world and learn about their culture and values.
I believe that during my internship I will get to know different job opportuinities and get a glimpse of what awaits me.
I can either choose to work abroad or return to my homeland and work at our family company.

<p><mark>Personal SWOT analysis</mark></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I am not afriad to adapt at all. I think I prefer to work alone but occasionaly working as a team is great too.
    My weakest point is probably mathematics. I am poor at handling stress and I am quite forgetfull.
    My greatest opportunity is right now at this university. I will try my best to adapt and succeed.
    I believe my time management is a threat. Eliminating this threat is my goal.

  <li>
    I am a beginner.
    To be honest I tried coding a few easy applications for fun and just to get a glimpse of what awaits me.
