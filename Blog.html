<p class="subtitle">Study choice</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It has always been my ambition to become a
    successful IT specialist. It is a step towards my future career.
    Thanks to my swift progress of my studies at Business Academy, it is glaring that studying is what I
    would like to engage in even more. While studying at Business Academy, I developed a keen interest
    in products, technology and their design. I consider it a vibrant experience to get the opportunity to meet
    students from all over the world and learn about their culture and values.
    I believe that during my internship I will get to know different job opportuinities and get a glimpse of what awaits me.
    I can either choose to work abroad or return to my homeland and work at our family company.

<p class="subtitle">Personal SWOT analysis</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I am not afriad to adapt at all. I think I prefer to work alone but occasionaly working as a team is great too.
    My weakest point is probably mathematics. I am poor at handling stress and I am quite forgetfull.
    My greatest opportunity is right now at this university. I will try my best to adapt and succeed.
    I believe my time management is a threat. Eliminating this threat is my goal.
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="subtitle">Programming Experience</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I am a beginner.
    To be honest I tried coding a few easy applications for fun and just to get a glimpse of what awaits me.
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="subtitle">First feedback</p>
<p class="line">Compliments</p>
<ul>
  <li>Good use of colour</li>
  <li>Nice usage of backgrounds on top of images</li>
  <li>Code quality is fine</li>
</ul>
<p class="line">Improvements</p>  
<ul>
  <li>File naming might cause issues = carelessness</li>
  <li>Usage of Inline styles = carelessness</li>
  <li>Capitalization of file names = carelessness</li>
</ul>
<p class="line">Code review feedback</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    My code review feedback was pretty much done orally. 
    It was basically just advice on how to space my pictures and text. 
    I believe I have already implemented that factor.
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="line">Tasks</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.	No inline styles</li>
  <li>2.	Clearer file naming</li>
  <li>3.	No capitalization of file names</li>
  <li>4.	Add a small company in my blog</li>
  <li>5.	Find out what issues iframe might cause</li>
    <!-- Iframe issues 
    insecure
    their reputation is tainted by unappropriate usage
    some sites doesnt allow being run in an iframe
    your site becomes vulnerable to cross-site attacks
    usability issues, problems with google
    might cause SEO problems
    -->
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="line">My thoughts</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I like to recieve feedback, it allows me to grow and improve.
    Everyone makes mistakes. I believe that allows us to learn what not to do and move on.
  </li>
</ul>
